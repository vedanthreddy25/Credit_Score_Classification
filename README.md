# Credit Score Classification Using Machine Learning

This repository contains the project files for the Credit Score Classification Using Machine Learning project, conducted as part of the Machine Learning course (DSCI-6003-03) at the University of New Haven, Dept. Of Electrical & Computer Engineering and Computer Science, Tagliatela College of Engineering.

## Project Overview

Credit scoring is a critical task in the financial industry, aimed at assessing the creditworthiness of individuals based on their financial history and other relevant factors. This project investigates the application of machine learning algorithms to classify credit scores into categories such as good, poor, and standard.


## Installation

To run this project, you need to have Python and the following libraries installed:

- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- jupyter

You can install the necessary libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn jupyter
